                manually to a nonexisting file.

                switched place, first functionality, thereafter verbose printing
                if needed.

-- VERSION 2.1 --

Working release, no proper documentation

-- GENERAL INFORMATION --

Unpack and point your webserver to the www dir. This contains the reporting php scripts.
You will need apache, php, sqlite3, impacket for python and screen as packages.
You can have the server itself send out a ping to a random ip and have the catcher 
report this 'heartbeat'. Session 0 is used for this.

I'd advice to start the catcher.py as root in a screen...

We use nmap to generate an input list of IP's. in the iplists folder you'll find 
a script for this purpose. The thrower has a reasonable help function that should 
get you going. More documentation is to follow.

Put heartbeat in crontab as root:

# m h  dom mon dow   command
  * *  *   *   *    /home/www-data/virtual_host_1/palea-express/thrower.py -t I -s 0 -i /home/www-data/virtual_host_1/palea-express/iplists/hartbeat.ips -c "YOUR IP"
